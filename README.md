# Jacob Green 

## What do I know? 

Quite a lot about probability theory and it's application to non-constructive combinatorics (see e.g. [my masters thesis](https://jg1011.github.io/)), chaotic dynamical systems (see e.g. my [PyDynSys library](https://github.com/jg1011/PyDynSys)) and the application data-engineering/data-scientific methods in the financial sector (examples are proprietary; specialty is in crypto HFT systems in rust, though as of late I've additionally been working with the Apache ecosystem in Python). I also have reasonable knowledge in the domain of reinforcement learning (particularly heirarchical systems, and more recently meta-RL). 

## What am I working on? 

- Adding further features, unit tests and docs to my [PyDynSys](https://github.com/jg1011/PyDynSys), getting ready to push v1.0.0 & leave the alpha stage
- Training heirarchical and meta reinforcement learning models to solve the tower of Hanoi problem with $N$ rings.
- Proprietary state-management software for DEX data obtained via Solana Validators

## Am I open to new roles? 

Yes! Feel free to contact me via email. 

## Am I open to collaboration 

Yes! I am particularly looking for collaborators on my [PyDynSys library](https://github.com/jg1011/PyDynSys), though I'd love to speak to people doing interesting things in non-constructive combinatorics.
